Contributing to Divolte Collector
=================================

We value contributions from the community to Divolte Collector. If you wish to contribute to the actual code in the
form of bug fixes, new features or other patches please bear in mind the following:

 - **Changes should be submitted for review and discussion via pull requests.**
   If you aren't sure of whether a pull request will be accepted, please discuss it first.
 - **Code needs to conform to the same style as the project.**
   We haven't formally defined a style in the hope that observing it is sufficient. We do have check-style and
   findbugs rules as guidance, and an [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) for formatting basics.
 - **Where possible, include tests.**
 - **Update documentation.**
   In particular if your change modifies the way configuration or mapping works, or changes something we've
   documented differently, the change needs to include an update to the project documentation.

Divolte Collector is currently maintained by [GoDataDriven](https://www.godatadriven.com/).

Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
----------------------------------

Contributions to the project are always welcome. However we do need to ensure that the project community,
users and maintainers are protected with respect to legal issues that can arise with contributions. As such we can
only accept contributions if they are your own original work and you license your work under the project license
(Apache License, Version 2.0).

In order to provide a sound legal basis for this we need you sign our CLA. These are modelled on Google's CLA
and are intended to strike a balance between respecting and protecting your rights and ours. As such:

  - All contributors must sign and submit to us the
    [*Individual* Contributor License Agreement](cla/divolte-cla-individual.pdf).
  - If you are employed or have an existing agreement in place transferring ownership of IP that you develop,
    you also need to have the [*Corporate* Contributor License Agreement](cla/divolte-cla-corporate.pdf)
    completed and submitted to us.

These agreements can be scanned and submitted to us [via email](maito:divolte@godatadriven.com).
